Hi! I am Sungwook Min, a rising junior studying Cognitive Science with a specialization in Machine Learning and Neural Computation at UC San Diego.

My first introduction to Machine Learning was in 2016 when I saw AlphaGo, a computer program developed by Google Deepmind that was trained to play the ancient game of Go at an exceptionally high level, play against Lee Sedol, one of the world's finest Go players. I was shocked by the capabilites and creativeness of an AI model and have since developed an interest in the field.

My research interest is in the intersection of **cognitive science** and **machine learning**, with a particular interest in **computer vision** and **deep neural networks**.
