**Hi, I'm Sungwook.**  
I'm a junior currently studying *Cognitive Science with a specialization in Machine Learning and Neural Computation* at UC San Diego. I'm originally from Seoul, Korea but I've also lived in Dubai, Minneapolis, and am currently based in San Diego.

Currently, I'm an undergraduate researcher at the [ISN Lab](https://isn.ucsd.edu/index.php) working on EEG data analysis and development of games that are played to collect EEG data using [CGX-32R](https://www.cgxsystems.com/quick-32r) headsets.

As someone who thrives at the crossroads of human cognition and artificial intelligence, I'm on an exhilarating journey to unravel the mysteries of the mind while harnessing the power of machines to augment our understanding of it.

### Why AI?
My first introduction to artificial intelligence was in 2016 when I saw AlphaGo, a computer program developed by Google Deepmind that was trained to play the ancient game of Go at an exceptionally high level, play against Lee Sedol, one of the world's finest Go players. I was shocked by the capabilites and creativeness of an AI model and have since developed a strong interest in the field with a mission to enhance the world using artificial intelligence.

### Research interests
My research interest is in the intersection of **cognitive science** and **machine learning**, with a particular interest in **computer vision** and **deep neural networks**.

### Ongoing work
Currently I'm working on computer vision, using deep neural networks and Tensorflow to recognize digits and objects through CNN, Convolutional Neural Network. After training my model using datasets such as MNIST, I'm now working on applying my models to recognize digits/objects through user input and live camera feeds.
