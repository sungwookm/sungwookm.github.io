Hi! I am Sungwook Min, a rising junior studying Cognitive Science with a specialization in Machine Learning and Neural Computation at UC San Diego. As someone who thrives at the crossroads of human cognition and artificial intelligence, I'm on an exhilarating journey to unravel the mysteries of the mind while harnessing the power of machines to augment our understanding of it.

My first introduction to artificial intelligence was in 2016 when I saw AlphaGo, a computer program developed by Google Deepmind that was trained to play the ancient game of Go at an exceptionally high level, play against Lee Sedol, one of the world's finest Go players. I was shocked by the capabilites and creativeness of an AI model and have since developed a strong interest in the field.

My research interest is in the intersection of **cognitive science** and **machine learning**, with a particular interest in **computer vision** and **deep neural networks**.
