This summer I worked as a research intern at [Seoul National University Artificial Intelligence Institute's Biointellignece Lab](https://bi.snu.ac.kr/) under the guidance of Professor Byoung-Tak Zhang.
During a 3 month research intern period, I primarily conducted research on machine learning, focusing on the areas of reinforced learning (RL) and neural networks.
My research topics also included topics such as decision-making under uncertainty, predicting outcomes, and RL in partially observable and noisy environments.

The following presentation is a presentation about Deep Q-Networks (DQN) from a RL seminar hosted by the lab.
DQN is a combination of Q-learning, a classic RL algorithm, alongside deep neural networks to handle complex tasks that involve high-dimensional state spaces.

The demo is a Google Colab link to the OpenAI GYM cartpole example included in the presentation.
